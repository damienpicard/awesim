Simulation Management
=====================

*Optimize your simulation workflow.*  
Simulation Management is written in **Python** and contains tools for pre- and post-processing of **Modelica** models.      

With Simulation Management you can:

    1. compile models, set parameters and solver options and start simulations 
    2. run simulations in parallel on the same computer or different machines
    3. open result files, access simulation parameters and trajectories, make plots
    4. keep an overview of your cases by creating an index (called simdex) of different results
    5. filter your results based on filenames or parameter sets 
      
Most of the tools provided are currently based on Dymola and the .mat result file.
